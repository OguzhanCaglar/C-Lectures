**Objective:** Understand the different stages of compiling a C program.

#### Instructions:
1. Research and explain the following stages of C program compilation:
   - Preprocessing
   - Compilation
   - Assembly
   - Linking
2. Create a simple C program (e.g., "Hello World!").
3. Describe what happens during each compilation stage for this program.
4. Visualize the compilation process by creating a flowchart or diagram.

**Deliverable:**
- Write a Markdown section describing each compilation stage.
- Include the "Hello World!" program as code.
- Provide a textual explanation and flowchart for the compilation process.

### Task 2: Identifying Components of a C Program
**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with the structure of a C program.

#### Instructions:
1. Create a list of key components of a basic C program. For example:
   - Header files
   - `main()` function
   - Variables
   - Comments
2. Analyze the following program and annotate its parts:
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       printf("Hello, C programming!\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```
3. Explain what each part of the code does.
4. Propose modifications to the code to:
   - Print multiple lines of output.
   - Include a variable.

**Deliverable:**
- Write a Markdown section describing the components of the program.
- Annotate the given program.
- Describe the proposed modifications and their effects.
